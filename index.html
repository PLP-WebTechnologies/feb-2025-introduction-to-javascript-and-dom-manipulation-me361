      <h2>The Night I Discovered the Magic of Code</h2>
      <p id="intro">
        It was a quiet Thursday night. The power had flickered earlier, leaving the streets dim, but my laptop’s glow kept the room alive. I wasn’t looking for anything special—just tinkering with a simple HTML page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added a button and gave it some style. Then came a click—and with it, a pop-up message I’d coded myself. “Hello, World,” it said. But to me, it felt like the start of a conversation with the universe. A line of code had created something. I was hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that night, I've spent countless hours exploring how code powers everything—from the apps on my phone to the robots in factories. Every project feels like building a piece of the future, and every bug I fix feels like solving a tiny mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve realized that programming isn’t just about commands and syntax. It’s about creativity, problem-solving, and sometimes, telling stories—like this one.
